# /implement-mvp

Implement the GuidedNotes MVP end-to-end as specified in /docs.

Hard requirements:
- Voice-first control for all core flows
- Big buttons as secondary input (Next/Repeat/Help/Back)
- Guided reading state machine
- Grounded Q&A with citations (chunk IDs)
- Formula tutor mode
- Visual Explorer with pointer movement narration:
  - line_graph + flowchart
- Narration throttling (dwell + transitions)
- Trace + reflection on “I’m done”

Finish by running /docs/09_acceptance_tests.md and reporting pass/fail.
