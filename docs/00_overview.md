# GuidedNotes — Overview

Tagline:
Turn lecture PDFs into a guided tutor you can control by voice. When visuals appear, explore them using mouse/trackpad while the AI narrates, then reflects what you explored.

## Primary users
- Visually impaired university students
- Low-vision students who prefer voice-guided pacing

## Core idea
Most accessibility tools read content linearly.
GuidedNotes is a stateful tutor:
- maintains “where we are”
- supports interruption (questions) and returns to the same spot
- provides special modes for formulas and visuals

## Modes
1) Reading Mode (default)
2) Q&A Mode (interruptible overlay)
3) Formula Tutor Mode
4) Visual Explorer Mode (signature)
5) Optional: Recap/Flashcards/Quiz

## Inputs
- Voice (primary)
- Big buttons (secondary, low-vision)
- Pointer movement (mouse/trackpad) in Visual Explorer

## Output
- Audio narration (TTS)
- Minimal on-screen text (optional)
